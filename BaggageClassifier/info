Mental Model

YOLO confidence → app.py (risk gating)
Rule validity → rule_engine.py (deterministic)
Rollback → metadata (is_active)
Time → rule selection



After adding confidence gating, temporal validity, and rollback,
the UI handles uncertainty, the rule engine enforces time-valid active rules,
and rollback is achieved via metadata, not destructive changes.
